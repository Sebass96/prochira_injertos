# Impact of Interstock and Rootstock on the Vigor and Productive Development of Mango (*Mangifera indica* L.) in San Lorenzo Valley, Piura, Peru.

## ABSTRACT

The mango tree (*Mangifera indica* L.) is a fruit tree known for its
vigorous growth. This crop is planted at low densities because of the
space it requires during vegetative development, which has a significant
effect on productivity per unit area. This research was conducted in the
Piura region, Peru. The objective of this study was to determine the
effects of the interaction between rootstock and interstock on the
agronomic characteristics and fruit biometrics of mangoes. A total of
216 ten-year-old mango trees were evaluated and planted at a distance of
6.0 m × 6.0 m over an area of 1.25 ha during the agricultural season
from 2017–2019. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with a 2 × 4
factorial arrangement and three blocks was used. The first factor
corresponded to the mango rootstock from the Chulucanas and Chato
varieties, whereas the second factor included the interstock from the
Chulucanas, Chato, Irwin, and Julie varieties. The results indicated
that the variety of cultivars used affects plant growth; however, it
does not influence the biometric characteristics of the fruits.
